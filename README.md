# Magma-Solitons-Modeling
Mathematica code for my research project modeling seismic and volcanic activity along the Mid-Atlantic ridge in Iceland using a novel geophysical model approximating the movement of magma as a soliton beneath the Earth's surface. 

Conducted at the UC Santa Barbara Center for Complex & Nonlinear Science. Supervised and co-authored by Professor Bj√∂rn Birnir.
